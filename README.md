# React + Vite

Spooky Halloween Counter is a creepy-cool web app built to celebrate the spooky season! 🕸️

This haunted counter lets users increase the count using the Spacebar, with a ghoulish limit to keep things under control (no counting zombies past 5! 🧟‍♂️). Designed with a custom Halloween-themed UI, it features:

🎃 Glowing deep purple visuals

👻 Spooky fog animation

💀 A maximum count of 5 (because more than that might summon something...)

⌨️ Keyboard-triggered interactions (Spacebar only — no clicks from the undead allowed)

Built using React + CSS, this fun project was made to practice event handling, state management, and custom styling — all with a touch of Halloween flair.

⚠️ Warning: Repeated pressing of the spacebar may summon the spirits of deprecated code... Use responsibly.

Let me know if you want a shorter version, or if you're adding things like deployment, contributors, or demo screenshots!

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
